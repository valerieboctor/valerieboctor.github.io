A parting gift for my friends. Almond sponge soaked in amaretto, layered with mascarpone chantilly, ultra-ripe cherry jam, and a soft ganache (60% cacao, in a 1:1.5 cream-to-chocolate ratio). The cake's grocery store bakery aesthetics—maraschino cherries, piped rosettes, candied oranges, sliced almonds and chocolate chunks— are reimagined with richer ingredients and a more indulgent, vaguely Italian, flavor profile.
