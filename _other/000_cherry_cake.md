A parting gift for the lovely friends at my going-away party. Almond sponge soaked in amaretto, layered with mascarpone chantilly, ultra-ripe cherry jam, and a soft-textured ganache (60% cacao, in a 1:1.5 cream-to-chocolate ratio). A nod to grocery store bakery aesthetics—maraschino cherries, piped rosettes, candied oranges, sliced almonds and chocolate chunks—reimagined with richer ingredients and a deeper, more indulgent flavor profile.
