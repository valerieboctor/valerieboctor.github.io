Berkeley's vivid food culture and  its abundance of gorgeous produce altered my life and passion for fine ingredients in a way that's hard to put into words. Fortunately I'll be carrying these memories forward through a budding confectionary business (stay tuned for the Q4 online store launch)! During my last chocolatiering session here in the Bay, I crafted these nostalgic peanut butter and jelly inspired chocolates. The milk chocolate shells cover fresh-ground peanut butter, spun with sea salt, a mild-tasting olive oil, madagascar vanilla beans, and wildflower honey, then crowned with fresh honeycomb shards. The dark chocolate shells encase a tangy raspberry cr√®me filling. Also included are classic, extra-dark handrolled truffles. One of my favorite Bay Area food memorie is a brief encounter with Samin Nosrat at a gardening supply in Albany. I recognized her immediately but was too shy to say anything that might feel objectifying or invasive, so I just stood there smiling at her gormlessly. When she finally looked over and gave a subtle nod as if to say *yep, it's really me*, I think I melted like one of my little truffles.
