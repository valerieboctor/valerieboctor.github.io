Alternating pralines with rosewater–white chocolate pistachio ganache (dark shells) and hazelnut dark chocolate ganache (light shells). For the dark chocolate shells, I use 60% cacao — bold, but still gentle enough to let the delicate notes of pistachio and rosewater shine through. Against the creamy white chocolate shells, single saffron threads add a slightly bitter floral twist that enhances the earthiness of the hazelnut filling. Recipes are my very own.
