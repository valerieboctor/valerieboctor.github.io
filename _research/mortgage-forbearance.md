excerpt: "Mortgage relief programs are crucial for distressed households during economic downturns, but their long-term effects remain underexplored. This paper offers new micro-level evidence on the long-term efficacy of mortgage payment pauses, or forbearance, in mitigating financial distress during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from 500,000 consumer credit reports, I study the causal effects of mortgage forbearance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act on household financial stability. Leveraging quasi-random variation in mortgage servicers' forbearance provision, I identify significant reductions in mortgage delinquency rates—up to 5 percentage points—and foreclosure rates by 1 percentage point, persisting three years post-forbearance. Additionally, the program had beneficial spillover effects on revolving credit stability, reducing credit card delinquencies by 2 percentage points and utilization rates by roughly 15 percentage points relative to the pre-pandemic period. Upon exiting forbearance, borrowers not only avoided financial 'rebound effects,' but also sustained improved financial stability for more than two years following the policy's implementation."

Mortgage relief programs are crucial for distressed households during economic downturns, but their long-term effects remain underexplored. This paper offers new micro-level evidence on the long-term efficacy of mortgage payment pauses, or forbearance, in mitigating financial distress during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from 500,000 consumer credit reports, I study the causal effects of mortgage forbearance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act on household financial stability. Leveraging quasi-random variation in mortgage servicers' forbearance provision, I identify significant reductions in mortgage delinquency rates—up to 5 percentage points—and foreclosure rates by 1 percentage point, persisting three years post-forbearance. Additionally, the program had beneficial spillover effects on revolving credit stability, reducing credit card delinquencies by 2 percentage points and utilization rates by roughly 15 percentage points relative to the pre-pandemic period. Upon exiting forbearance, borrowers not only avoided financial 'rebound effects,' but also sustained improved financial stability for more than two years following the policy's implementation.
