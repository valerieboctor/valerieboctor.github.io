title: "Fiscal Deficits and Inflation Risks: the Role of Fiscal and Monetary Regimes"
collection: research
category: manuscripts
permalink: /research/bis-1
excerpt: 'Using data from a panel of advanced economies over four decades, we show that the
inflationary effect of fiscal deficits crucially depends on the prevailing fiscal-monetary
policy regime. Under a fiscally-led regime, defined as a regime in which the government does not adjust the primary balance to stabilise debt and the central bank is
less independent or puts less emphasis on price stability, the average effect on inflation of higher deficits is found to be up to five times larger than under a monetary-led
regime. Under a fiscally-led regime, higher deficits also increase the dispersion of possible future inflationary outcomes, especially the probability of high inflation. Based
on forecasts from our model, the high inflation experienced by many countries during
the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic appears more consistent with a fiscally-led
regime than a monetary-led regime.'
