I am a Berkeley-trained Ph.D. Economist with expertise in consumer finance, stress testing, and financial risk modeling. I lead end-to-end research projects, from large-scale data engineering to advanced causal inference and statistical analysis. My recent research examines the long-term balance sheet impacts of federally-backed mortgage payment pauses during the COVID-19 pandemic. I combine technical rigor with strong communication skills to deliver actionable, data-driven insights at major financial institutions, including Capital One, the Bank for International Settlements and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

In 2021, I collaborated with economists at the Bank for International Settlements to analyze the impacts of fiscal deficits on inflation risk during the COVID-19 crisis. Our work was featured in the [International Monetary Fund Seminars Recommended Reading](https://meetings.imf.org/-/media/AMSM/Files/AM2022/Seminars/2022RR-Debate-on-the-Global-Economy.ashx) in 2022.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I graduated *summa cum laude* from Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Science in Economics, Political Science, and Modern Foreign Languages (Arabic and French). During my time at Syracuse, I also served as a Compliance Risk Policy Analyst in the Compliance Risk Policy Division at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, where I focused on regulatory compliance and risk management policies for commercial banks.

In August 2025, I will join Capital One's headquarters as a Principal Quantitative Modeler.  Please feel free to download my [resume](../files/current-resume.pdf) or [CV](../files/2024-10-24-CV.pdf).
